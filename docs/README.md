# 📚 VCOP Collateral Protocol

Welcome to the official documentation of the VCOP Collateral Protocol! This innovative system combines a stablecoin pegged to the Colombian peso with a flexible and advanced lending platform.

## 🚀 What is VCOP Collateral?

VCOP Collateral is a dual DeFi protocol that offers:

- **🪙 VCOP Stablecoin**: Pegged 1:1 to the Colombian peso (COP)
- **💰 Lending System**: Multi-asset platform with advanced risk management
- **🔄 Automatic PSM**: Parity Stability Module to maintain price
- **📊 Risk Analysis**: Real-time metrics with 15+ indicators

## 🌟 Current Status

**✅ FULLY DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL** on Base Sepolia

All components are functioning and have been validated in production.
