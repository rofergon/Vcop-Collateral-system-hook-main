# 🚀 VCOP OPERATING SYSTEM GUIDE

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The VCOP protocol is **deployed with advanced functionality** on Base Sepolia, offering two sophisticated systems:

1. **VCOPCollateral**: Advanced stablecoin with automatic PSM and Uniswap v4 integration
2. **Core System**: Professional-grade flexible lending platform with multi-asset support

### 📊 **RISK ANALYSIS SYSTEM (PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION)**

#### **RiskCalculator Status**
```
⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATION: Key functions not fully implemented
- _getAssetHandler() reverts with "Handler lookup not implemented"
- Some price metrics return placeholders
- Historical data analysis not implemented

✅ Implemented Features:
  - Basic risk level categorization
  - Mathematical formulas for ratios
  - Risk threshold constants

```

#### **Risk Levels (Theoretical)**
```
🟢 HEALTHY (>200%): Very safe position
🟡 WARNING (150-200%): Monitoring recommended  
🟠 DANGER (120-150%): High risk
🔴 CRITICAL (110-120%): Extreme risk
⚫ LIQUIDATABLE (<110%): Eligible for liquidation

**NOTE: These work conceptually but depend on oracle data that may not be fully reliable**
```

## 🧪 **TESTING COMMANDS (AVAILABLE)**

### **Core System Testing**
```bash

make test-loan-repayment     # Repayment functionality
```

### **VCOP System Testing**
```bash
# Stablecoin system tests (basic functionality)
make test-new-system         # Basic VCOP operations

# PSM operations (with hardcoded rates):
make swap-usdc-to-vcop       # Swap USDC → VCOP
make swap-vcop-to-usdc       # Swap VCOP → USDC
make check-psm               # PSM status check

```

### **Liquidity Management**
```bash
# Liquidity provision (implemented):
make provide-eth-liquidity   # Add ETH liquidity
make check-vault             # Vault status check
make check-tokens            # Token balance checks
```

### **Case 1: Conservative Loan (GenericLoanManager)**
```
Scenario: User deposits ETH, borrows USDC
Implementation Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
Process:
1. Complete asset verification system
2. LTV calculations working (max 80%) 
3. Collateralization ratios enforced
4. Liquidation system operational (120% threshold)
5. Interest accrual and risk monitoring
```

```

### **Functional but Limited**
```
⚠️ Basic loan creation and management works
⚠️ PSM swaps work but with artificial rates
