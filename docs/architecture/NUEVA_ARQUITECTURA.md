# üèóÔ∏è NEW MODULAR ARCHITECTURE FOR COLLATERALIZED LOANS

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The new architecture transforms the protocol from a monolithic VCOP-centric system to a modular platform that supports **any token as collateral OR as a loan asset**, including external tokens that the protocol cannot mint/burn.

## üéØ ACHIEVED OBJECTIVES

### ‚úÖ Total Flexibility
- **Any ERC20** can be collateral
- **Any ERC20** can be a loan token
- Support for tokens with/without minting control
- Unified interface for all asset types

### ‚úÖ Vault System
- For external tokens (ETH, WBTC, etc.)
- Liquidity provided by LPs
- Interest for liquidity providers
- Dynamic interest rate calculation

### ‚úÖ Hybrid Oracles
- Chainlink for reliable prices
- Uniswap v4 as fallback
- Manual prices for testing
- Support for multiple token pairs

### ‚úÖ Risk Management
- Collateralization ratios per asset
- Automatic liquidations
- Exposure limits per token
- Bonuses for liquidators

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS

### 1. CORE INTERFACES

#### `IAssetHandler`
```solidity
// Unified interface for handling different asset types
enum AssetType {
    MINTABLE_BURNABLE,  // VCOP and similar tokens
    VAULT_BASED,        // ETH, WBTC, external tokens
    REBASING            // Tokens with rebase mechanisms
}
```

#### `ILoanManager`
```solidity
// Loan management with any asset combination
struct LoanTerms {
    address collateralAsset;  // Any token as collateral
    address loanAsset;        // Any token as loan
    uint256 collateralAmount;
    uint256 loanAmount;
    uint256 maxLoanToValue;
    uint256 interestRate;
    uint256 duration;
}
```

#### `IGenericOracle`
```solidity
// Flexible oracle system
enum PriceFeedType {
    CHAINLINK,    // Chainlink feeds
    UNISWAP_V4,   // Uniswap v4 pools
    MANUAL,       // Manual prices
    HYBRID        // Combined sources
}
```

### 2. ASSET HANDLERS

#### `MintableBurnableHandler`
- **Purpose**: Handles tokens that the protocol can mint/burn
- **Use cases**: VCOP, protocol's own tokens
- **Operation**: 
  - Mints tokens directly to lender
  - Burns tokens from lender upon repayment
  - "Infinite" liquidity (limited by safety parameters)

#### `VaultBasedHandler`
- **Purpose**: Handles external tokens requiring vaults
- **Use cases**: ETH, WBTC, USDC, DAI, etc.
- **Operation**:
  - Liquidity providers deposit tokens
  - Utilization-based interest system
  - Lenders receive tokens from vault
  - Repayments go back to vault

### 3. LOAN MANAGER

#### `GenericLoanManager`
- **Total flexibility**: Any token as collateral + any token as loan
- **Position management**: Create, modify, liquidate positions
- **Risk calculations**: LTV, collateralization ratios, limits
- **Handler integration**: Delegates operations to specific handlers

### 4. MOCK TOKENS FOR TESTING

```solidity
// MockETH.sol - 18 decimals
// MockWBTC.sol - 8 decimals  
// MockUSDC.sol - 6 decimals
```

## üîÑ OPERATIONAL FLOW

### Scenario 1: VCOP Loan with ETH as Collateral
```
1. User deposits ETH as collateral
2. VaultBasedHandler verifies VCOP liquidity available
3. MintableBurnableHandler mints VCOP to user
4. Position created with ETH collateral + VCOP loan
```

### Scenario 2: ETH Loan with WBTC as Collateral
```
1. User deposits WBTC as collateral
2. VaultBasedHandler verifies ETH liquidity available
3. VaultBasedHandler transfers ETH from vault to user
4. Position created with WBTC collateral + ETH loan
```

### Scenario 3: USDC Loan with VCOP as Collateral
```
1. User deposits VCOP as collateral
2. VaultBasedHandler verifies USDC liquidity available
3. VaultBasedHandler transfers USDC from vault to user
4. Position created with VCOP collateral + USDC loan
```

## üìä COMPARISON: BEFORE vs AFTER

| Aspect | Current System | New Architecture |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Loan tokens** | Only VCOP | Any ERC20 |
| **Collateral** | Only USDC | Any ERC20 |
| **Token control** | Absolute (mint/burn) | Flexible (mint/burn + vaults) |
| **Liquidity** | Unlimited (minting) | Vaults + LPs + minting |
| **Oracles** | Only VCOP/COP | Multiple pairs |
| **Flexibility** | Low | Very high |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Excellent |

   ```solidity
   // Configure VCOP as mintable/burnable
   mintableBurnableHandler.configureAsset(
       vcopAddress,
       1500000, // 150% collateral ratio
       1200000, // 120% liquidation ratio
       10000000 * 1e6, // 10M VCOP max
       50000 // 5% interest rate
   );
   
   // Configure ETH as vault-based
   vaultBasedHandler.configureAsset(
       mockETHAddress,
       1300000, // 130% collateral ratio
       1100000, // 110% liquidation ratio
       1000 * 1e18, // 1000 ETH max
       80000 // 8% interest rate
   );
   ```

3. **Migrate existing positions**
   ```solidity
   // Script to migrate positions from previous system
   // to new GenericLoanManager
   ```

4. **Update frontend**
   ```javascript
   // New functions to interact with multiple tokens
   // UI for selecting collateral and loan asset
   // Dashboards for vault LPs
   ```
