=== DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW ARCHITECTURE ===

1. SETUP DEPENDENCIES:
   - Run: git submodule update --init --recursive
   - Run: forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
   - Run: forge install uniswap/v4-core
   - Run: forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts

2. FIX COMPILATION ISSUES:
   The project currently has version conflicts between Uniswap v4 dependencies.
   You may need to:
   - Update remappings.txt
   - Use specific versions of dependencies
   - Exclude problematic contracts from compilation

3. DEPLOY MOCK TOKENS:
   forge script script/deploy/DeployNewArchitecture.s.sol --sig "deployMockTokens()"

4. DEPLOY CORE CONTRACTS:
   Once compilation works, deploy the actual contracts:
   - MintableBurnableHandler
   - VaultBasedHandler  
   - GenericLoanManager
   - FlexibleLoanManager
   - RiskCalculator

5. CONFIGURE ASSETS:
   - VCOP as mintable/burnable (150% collateral ratio)
   - ETH as vault-based (130% collateral ratio)
   - WBTC as vault-based (140% collateral ratio)
   - USDC as vault-based (110% collateral ratio)

6. PROVIDE INITIAL LIQUIDITY:
   Add liquidity to vault-based handlers for ETH, WBTC, USDC

7. TEST THE SYSTEM:
   - Create loans with different collateral/loan combinations
   - Test risk calculations
   - Test liquidations

=== ADVANTAGES OF NEW ARCHITECTURE ===

✅ FLEXIBILITY: Any token as collateral or loan asset
✅ MODULARITY: Asset handlers for different token types  
✅ SCALABILITY: Easy to add new assets without code changes
✅ RISK MANAGEMENT: 15+ on-chain risk metrics
✅ ULTRA-FLEXIBLE: No hardcoded ratio limits (FlexibleLoanManager)

=== COMPARISON WITH EXISTING SYSTEM ===

OLD SYSTEM:
- Only VCOP mintable loans
- Only USDC as collateral
- Hardcoded ratios
- Limited scalability

NEW SYSTEM:
- Any ERC20 as loan asset
- Any ERC20 as collateral
- Configurable ratios per asset
- Unlimited scalability
- Professional risk management tools
