# üõ†Ô∏è Challenges I Ran Into

## **Designing Scalable Auto-Liquidation with Chainlink Automation**

The main challenge: **How to create an autonomous liquidation system that scales from 10 to 10,000 loans without breaking the bank on gas costs?**

### **Key Design Challenges:**

#### **1. Scalability vs. Cost**
- **Problem**: Checking each position individually becomes prohibitively expensive
- **Solution**: Batch processing - review 20 positions at once instead of one-by-one

#### **2. Autonomous Decision Making**
- **Problem**: Who liquidates positions 24/7 without human intervention?
- **Solution**: Chainlink Automation with custom logic triggers

#### **3. Capital Requirements**
- **Problem**: Liquidators need upfront capital to repay debts
- **Solution**: Vault-funded system provides capital automatically

#### **4. Economic Sustainability**
- **Problem**: Automation costs (LINK tokens) vs. protocol security
- **Solution**: Intelligent batching reduces gas costs by ~80%

### **The Breakthrough:**

**Batch Processing Philosophy:**
```
‚ùå Traditional: Check position 1, then 2, then 3...
‚úÖ Our Solution: Check positions 1-20 together

Result: 1,000 positions = 50 batches instead of 1,000 individual checks
```

### **Final Impact:**

Transformed liquidation from a **manual, capital-intensive process** into a **fully automated, capital-efficient system** that maintains security at any scale.
